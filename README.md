# MERN Admin Dashboard

This will be an admin dashboard with list of products, customers, transactions, sales data (I've already tried Recharts in my previous project - job-sync, now I will use Nivo for comparison)

This is all to what I came up so far, can add more stuff later.

**Technologies: Redux Toolkit, React Router, MaterialUI, styled-components, Nivo Charts**

Backend is here:
